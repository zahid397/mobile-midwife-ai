# 🤰 Mobile Midwife AI  
### AI-powered Pregnancy Risk Awareness Assistant  

**Mobile Midwife AI** is a lightweight, mobile-first web application designed to help pregnant mothers get **early risk awareness** based on their symptoms.  
This project focuses on **accessibility, simplicity, and Bangla-first UX** for real-world impact.

---

## 🌟 Motivation
In many rural and semi-urban areas, pregnant women often ignore early symptoms due to lack of awareness or access to doctors.  
**Mobile Midwife AI** aims to act as a **digital first step**, not a replacement for doctors.

> ⚠️ This app is for awareness only — not a medical diagnosis.



## 🚀 Features
- 📝 Symptom input in **Bangla / English**
- 📅 Pregnancy month selection
- 🧠 AI-like risk analysis (Low / Medium / High)
- 🎨 Clean, mobile-friendly UI (inspired by real apps like bKash)
- ⚡ Fast & lightweight (React + Tailwind)
- 🌐 Deployed on **Vercel**



## 🧪 Risk Logic (Demo Version)
- **HIGH risk** → bleeding, severe pain  
- **MEDIUM risk** → fever, headache, vomiting  
- **LOW risk** → no critical symptoms detected  

> Logic is rule-based for demo purposes (can be upgraded to ML / LLM).
